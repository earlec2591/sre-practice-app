# This file tells GitHub Actions WHAT to do and WHEN to do it.
# It lives in your repo, so it's version-controlled just like your code.
# WHY: "Pipeline as code" means your CI/CD config is reviewable,
# auditable, and reproducible — core SRE principles.

name: CI Pipeline

# WHEN to run this pipeline:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]       # Run on every push to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]       # Run on PRs targeting main

jobs:
  test:
    # WHERE to run: a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # WHY: The runner starts empty. This copies your repo into it.
      
      # Step 2: Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      
      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest
      
      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest test_app.py -v
  
  build-docker:
    # This job runs AFTER tests pass
    needs: test  # "needs" creates a dependency between jobs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Verify the Docker image builds successfully
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t sre-practice-app:${{ github.sha }} .
        # ${{ github.sha }} tags the image with the commit hash
        # WHY: Tagging with the commit hash means you can always trace
        # a running container back to the exact code that built it.
        # This is critical during incidents when you need to know
        # "what version is actually running?"
